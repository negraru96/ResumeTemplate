            Having the ability of closing sales, pitching, effective communication
            and comprehension are must-have traits in a sales system and I can
            say that these skills have grown on me throughout the years of work,
            non-profit and personal experience. My understanding and
            execution of service dynamics is what makes me have an effective sales core.
