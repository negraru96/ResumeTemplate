            I treasure my ability to be creative, it is one of the most
            meaningful gifts given to me. So my work is just that – a piece of
            life from my perspective to yours.

            <p class="projsummary">- Coming up to
              October ’18, I spent some time coding my own photography
              website, designing it and updating it with my work along the way.
              I now post new work on it whenever I get the chance. <br/>
              - Up until
              now, I’ve also made graphics via Adobe Cloud tools for my clients.
              Like I mentioned previously, I was also involved to be a personal food photographer for a
              catering staff. <br/>
              - I brainstorm, plan and direct my own unique
              scenarios with the help of models. The
              edits I post on my webpage show great detail and are individual
              projects I work on.
