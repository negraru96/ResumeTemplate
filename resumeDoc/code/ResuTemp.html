            I treasure my ability to be creative, it is one of the most
            meaningful gifts given to me. So my work is just that – a piece of
            life from my perspective to yours.

          <p class="freesummary">Through my quest of exploration, I have had
            the privilege of seeing marvelous places and meeting beautiful
            people. While photography was always a hobby of mine, I decided to
            monetize it and make a small business in October 2018. Mostly
            gaining work through word of mouth, I met many folks and learned
            many things through this path. I have also been told that my artwork
            grew in quality over time. I realized that there are too many great
            moments to capture in photography, so I have an inability to
            specialize in just one form. In my gallery, you will see my work of
            people, places, food and events. I’ve taken gigs with chefs for food
            showcasing, models for special sets, Artists for musical covers and
            visuals. I also use my knowledge in graphic design to make outstanding
            pieces and blowups for those that want unique art done for them.
